# Headphones Design from Scratch

 project, to implement designing from scratch using Figma, HTML and CSS 




0. Read and be familiar with Figma
For this task, please write an amazing README.md

1. Header
Building a web page the right way, is not easy - expect if you put in place strong foundations:

reset CSS styling
use variables
simple/“as generic as you can” CSS selectors
avoid as more as you can super specific CSS selector
simple HTML structure - div containers are your friend!
Last advice: I always start to build a web page from outside to inside and from top to bottom.
Now, your turn!

For this first task: create the header/hero piece

Desktop:

Desktop header

Mobile:

Mobile header

2. "What we do..." section
Copy files from the previous task.

For this second task: create the “What we do…” section

Important: try to build as generic as you can… you will probably need some components in next section.

3. "Our results" section
For this third task: create the “Our results” section

Now you can reuse components form the previous task!

4. Contact us
A good landing page has always a contact form.

You are free to add any animations and/or constraints on fields.

5. Footer
Last piece of the page… the Footer!

When you are done, here the result:
